## 🧩 Core Gameplay Mechanics

**On-Chain Haunting** is designed like a living, meme-powered spirit world. Here's how players interact:

* **👻 Summon Ghosts**
  Players mint ghost NFTs, each with unique traits and personalities — from spooky Wraiths to charming Poltergeists.

* **🗺️ Explore the Map**
  A map shows all active ghosts and hauntings. Players can view random ghosts, attempt riddles to possess them, or just watch the chaos unfold.

* **💀 Possess or Get Possessed**
  Solve a riddle tied to a ghost to gain control of it. Fail, and the ghost gets stronger. Possessed ghosts can be used to haunt wallets or battle others.

* **💞 Ghost Mating**
  During Meme Mating Season, two ghosts can fuse into a new hybrid spirit. The offspring inherits randomized traits and sometimes unlocks weird new powers.

* **🎭 Social Possession**
  Ghosts can “possess” real wallet addresses, causing small UI glitches or game effects. Other players can see and exorcise these hauntings for points.

* **🏆 Chaos Points & Leaderboards**
  All actions — summoning, possessing, fusing — earn Chaos Points. The top ghosts and players rise in rank... or haunt the leaderboard forever.

## 👻 Ghost Classes & Traits

Every ghost in **On-Chain Haunting** is unique — but they fall into different **classes** and come with randomized **traits** that directly impact gameplay.

### 🏷️ Ghost Classes

Ghosts belong to different supernatural types, each with distinct vibes and behaviors:

* **Wraith** – Fast and slippery. Great at possession, harder to exorcise.
* **Poltergeist** – Aggressive and chaotic. Can overpower weaker ghosts.
* **Banshee** – High riddle difficulty. Loud, unpredictable energy.
* **Specter** – Balanced ghost type, good for fusion or utility.
* **Phantom** – Rare and mysterious. Sometimes immune to possession.

### 🧬 Core Traits (randomly generated at mint)

Each ghost has 3–5 traits that influence gameplay:

| Trait                 | What It Affects                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mischief**          | Increases possession success rate                      |
| **Haunting Power**    | Makes exorcisms harder                                 |
| **Charisma**          | Helps in ghost mating/fusion outcomes                  |
| **Riddle Resistance** | Makes it harder for others to steal/possess your ghost |
| **Chaos Factor**      | Boosts point gain from interactions                    |

## 🧠 Possessing Wallets

One of the most chaotic and creative features of **On-Chain Haunting** is the ability to **possess wallets** using your ghosts.

### How it works:

* On the map, players can view **random ghost avatars** wandering.
* To possess one, you must **solve a riddle** tied to that ghost’s traits.
* If correct — that ghost is now **under your control**, and the wallet it’s bound to becomes **"haunted"**.
* If wrong — the ghost becomes **stronger**, gaining extra resistance and traits.

### What possession does:

* Possessed wallets may experience **visual glitches**, slower UI, or other strange effects in-game.
* They become **targets for exorcism or challenges** from other players.
* The longer a possession lasts, the more **Chaos Points** the ghost owner earns.

It’s PvP... with paranormal energy.

## 💞 Meme Mating: Ghost Fusion

In **Meme Mating Season**, ghosts don’t just haunt — they fall in love (or at least, merge into strange hybrids).

### How it works:

* Select **two ghosts** from your collection.
* If they’re compatible, they enter a fusion ritual.
* The result is a **brand new ghost** — an “Ectoshadow Baby” — with blended traits and a random class.

### Why it’s fun:

* Fused ghosts can inherit rare combinations of powers.
* Some combos unlock **secret traits** or aesthetic variations.
* Breeding becomes a strategy — not just for rarity, but for building powerful haunting lineups.

It’s like Pokémon breeding, but with haunted vibes.
